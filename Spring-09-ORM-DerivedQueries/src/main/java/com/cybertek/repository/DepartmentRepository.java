        Define the query methods in a repository interface('DepartmentRepository') that extends one of the Spring Dataâ€™s repositories('JpaRepository')
        Spring Data JPA will create queries automatically by parsing these method names.
        Naming convention must be followed
        Introducer clause like FIND, READ, QUERY, COUNT, or GET which tells JPA what you want to do with the method.
        This clause can contain further expressions, such as DISTINCT to set a distinct flag on the query to be created.
        Criteria clause that starts after the first BY keyword which acts as a delimiter to indicate the start of the actual query criteria.
        The criteria clause is where you define conditions on entity properties and concatenate them with AND, and OR keywords.
